Dataset/pcap_files:
-	Contains 101 folders. Each contains mobile traffic of one app as pcap files.
-	Each pcap file contains mobile traffic from many devices (maximum is 8).

Dataset/raw_data
-	Contains 101 folders. Each folder is for one app.
-	One app_folder contains: raw and extracted.
+ Dataset/raw_data/<appname>/raw: contains csv files (created by pcap files)
+ Dataset/raw_data/<appname>/extracted: csv files. Each csv file contains mobile traffic from just one device.

Dataset/sources
-	Contains 101 folders. Each folder is for one app.
-	All csv files in dataset/source/app_i are the same as in dataset/raw_data/app_i/extracted, but the file name is format like: <appname>_<index>_<duration>m.csv

Dataset/5_3
-	For 5 minutes traffic dataset, overalp 3 minutes.
